<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TheAudioDBApi</p>

<p>API Project: Pulls artist info from api. Info checked against criteria for future availability.<br>
  Includes: Artist Name, Image, Year Career Started, Genre, About,and Year of Passing(if artist has passed away)</p>

<h2>Optimizations:</h2>
<p>This project uses whether artist is living or passed as criteria to determine if they are available to perform. <br>
If artist is alive, displays "This artist is available to perform." If artist has passed away, displays "As of (year of passing), <br>
this artist is not available to perform."</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>Very basic API project. I can see how this capability could be useful if right criteria is used. <br>
  Also had to use conditional to get rid of null values.</p>
